# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This repository contains the back-end for the WTWR (What to Wear?) application.
The project focuses on building a secure and scalable server with:
user authorization & authentication
centralized error handling
request validation using Celebrate/Joi
REST API for managing users and clothing items
MongoDB database integration
The server is built with Node.js, Express.js, and Mongoose.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
